Hiptime is a task management application. It is essentially a replica of the popular todoist.com. This application can be used by individuals, small teams and professionals to manage anything from a shopping list to major projects. It can serve as a simple task manager or a collaborative tool for teams.

I began this project by first reviewing the requirements, using todoist.com as a guide. Then I sketched the app's pages, elements and assets on a plain paper. Then I wireframe it using InVision. I then started the development process with Rails 5 following the MVC pattern. I used Bootsrap-Sass for the styling and Devise to build the authentication system.
