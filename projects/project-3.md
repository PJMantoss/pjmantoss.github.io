The tech university app is for managing students' enrollments for courses. It allows the students of the fictional Tech University to enroll for a course by signing up and adding courses to their portal. Registered students can view other students and the courses they are offering. 

I build this app using Rails 5 and MaterializeCSS as front-end. This project gave me an opportunity to increase my understanding of Rails 5 MVC structure, naming conventions, how the root route works and many-to-many associations. I also learnt how to use Partials and perform CRUD operations from the back-end.
