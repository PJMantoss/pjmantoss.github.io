This is a project management app that is meant for planning, organizing and tracking tasks in a project. It is built with Rails 5 and SASS.
  
In this project I gained more experience with full-stack web application design and associated technologies including [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) for database storage and Bootstrap-Sass CSS Framework for the user interface.
